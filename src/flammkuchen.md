# Flammkuchen

A recipe for Flammkuchen, a very thin crust pizza-like dish, from Elsass.

- Servings: 2

## Ingredients

- 400g [pizza Dough](pizza-dough).
- 1 onion.
- 150g bacon (replaceable with mushrooms or other vegetables).
- 2 big spoons of sour cream.

## Directions

1. Flatten the dough as thin as possible (1-2 mm).
2. Once the dough is flat, put it on your baking tray and preheat the oven at
   450 to 500 Fahrenheit.
3. Distribute the sour cream evenly (it should be a very thin layer, just barely
   covering the dough.
4. Cut the onion and bacon into small pieces and distribute onion,
   bacon/vegetables (also in small pieces) evenly.
5. Put in the oven for 10 minutes and take it out when it is getting a bit dark.
   The thin parts will get a bit brown.
6. Put salt and pepper.

It's recommended to take it down from the baking tray and let it cool down for
2-5 minutes before eating.
