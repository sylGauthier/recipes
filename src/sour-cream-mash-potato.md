# Sour Cream Mash Potatoes

## Ingredients

- Potatoes.
- Sour cream.
- Butter.
- Milk.

## Directions

1. Peel and dice up your potatoes.
2. Boil them on medium heat in a pot of slightly salty water until they begin to
   fall apart when poked with a fork.
3. Turn off the heat and pour off the water.
4. Mash up the potatoes to the chunkiness you desire.
5. While the potatoes are still warm, add a generous amount of butter and
   shredded cheese and stir.
6. Add a very small amount of milk and stir (be conservative here, the sour
   cream will provide most of the softness of the mash).
7. Begin adding sour cream and thoroughly mixing until the mash reaches your
   desired consistency.
