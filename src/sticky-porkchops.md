4. Cover the dish with clingfilm, then chill in the fridge for 1h 30 minutes.

6. Heat some olive oil (vegetable oil should be fine too) in a pan over medium
   heat, then place your pork chops in the pan and cook for 10-15 minutes or
   until cooked through.
7. Take the pork chops out the pan, then rest for a couple of minutes before
   slicing and serving.
