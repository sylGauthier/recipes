**Sauce For the Buns**

## Directions

1. Prep your chicken by trimming it into less than a 1/2" patties for frying.
2. Prepare your batter and flour in two separate bowls.
3. Dunk your chicken into the flour, then batter and then flour again. While
   your chicken is sitting with the battered flour pour 2 1/2 cups of cooking
   oil into your pan over medium heat or 350 degrees. Let it come to temp, about
   20 minutes.
4. Once your oil has reached the temp of 350, fry 3-4 pieces of chicken at one
   time. Fry for 7 minutes (flipping at the midway point) and then pull the
   chicken and let sit for 5 minutes then re-fry for the second time 3 minutes,
   depending on the thickness of the chicken.
5. Now that your chicken is fried make sure you have a wire rack with a sheet
   pan under it so the crispy chicken can sit and rest on. During this resting
   time, add your Nashville Hot Chicken seasoning together with 1 1/2 cups of
   the cooking oil you just used. It will simmer but quickly whisk until it
   comes still. Brush sauce all over the crispy chicken or dunk it.
6. Have some toasted buns ready and create your sandwich. Sauce top and bottom
   buns, add shredded romaine lettuce, chicken patty, tomato, then complete with
   top bun.
7. Serve.
