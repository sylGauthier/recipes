# Onion Raitha (Indian Tzatziki)

Raitha is an yogurt-based Indian style sauce that goes great with rice dishes
such as Pilau and [Biriyani](lamb-biriyani). It's quite similar to a Greek
Tzatziki and is quick and quite easy to make. It's great especially with very
spicy Indian dishes as it provides a sweet and cooling effect.
