   over the tray's items. Cook for another 20 minutes.
3. Prepare the chicken stock and wine to take out the roasting tray for the last
   time before serving. Pour 200ml of chicken stock and 100ml of white wine over
   the tray's contents and return it to the oven for a final 20 minutes of
   cooking.
