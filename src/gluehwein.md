# Glühwein - mulled wine

A recipe for Glühwein/mulled wine a beverage you can find at almost every
European Christmas market. This recipe is optimized for flavor rather than
alcohol content (it still kicks in).

- Yields: 1 liter.

## Ingredients

- 300 ml Cassis-Juice (Johannesbeer), replaceable with any other juice.
- 1 bottle 700ml red wine.
- 50 g Sugar.
- 25 g Raisins.
- 1 orange.
- 1 cinnamon bark.
- 1 spoon ginger powder (or a bit of fresh ginger).
- 1 spoon cloves.
- 5 star anise.
- If spice is not available, sweet cinnamon tea bags also work.

## Directions

1. Cut the orange in nice looking pieces (since they are mainly decoration).
2. Throw everything in a pot.
3. Warm up (don't boil).
