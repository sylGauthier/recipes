# Brigadeiro

A very traditional brazilian dessert that is present in every brazilian birthday
party.

## Ingredients

- One can of condensed milk.
- Three or four spoons of chocolate powder or cocoa powder.
- One spoon of butter.
- Sprinkles (optional).

## Instructions

1. Add all the ingredients into a pan.
2. Put it under low heat and stir it (preferably with a wooden spoon) it until
   it starts sticking to the bottom of the pan.
3. Remove it from the pan and eat it with a spoon or wait for it to cool down
   and roll it into small balls.
4. While it is hot you can roll it around in sprinkles.

## Notes

Depending on how much brigadeiro you want to do, you'll have
to add more or less of each ingredient, so be creative! Be careful with the
chocolate powder, you definitely do not want to add too much of it!
