# Tuscan Style Pork Roast

An herbaceous pancetta stuffed pork roast with a crispy exterior. Finished with
a lemon vinaigrette.

- Prep time: 30 minutes.
- Cook time: 2 hours.
- Serves: 6-8.

## Equipment

- Food processor.
- Fine mesh strainer.
- Cast iron skillet.
- Butchers twine.

## Ingredients

- 1 pork Roast.
- 2-3 Tbsp fresh rosemary.
- 8 cloves garlic, minced.
- ⅓ cup high quality olive oil.
- 1 lemon.
- 4 oz pancetta or bacon.
- 1 tsp fresh parsley.

## Directions

1.	Preheat oven to 275°F (135°C)
2.	Butterfly the roast by cutting into three parts by cutting into the side
    starting a third of the way up the roast. When you get to the end of the
    roast open it up and repeat for the remaining roast. You're opening it up
    like a pamphlet.
2.	Cover with plastic wrap and beat with meat mallet to pound the pork to an
    even levelness.
3.	Mince garlic cloves(8) with the rosemary(2 Tbsp). Place into a cold pan with
    olive oil(⅓ cup) and zest of lemon(1). Keep lemon for later.
4.	Bring to slow simmer on medium low heat for 2-3 minutes. Strain the herbs
    making sure to squeeze all excess oil. Reserve oil for later.
5.	Add pancetta/bacon(4 oz) to food processor. Pulse a few times before adding
    the garlic/rosemary mixture. Process until a smooth paste forms.
6.	Salt and pepper both sides of the roast before placing the roast fat side
    down and spreading the paste over the roast leaving about a 2 inch gap on
    one side.
7.	Roll tightly towards the 2 inch gap and use butchers twine to secure the
    roll. Place a knot every inch or so.
8.	Bake at 275°F (135°C) for 2 hours or until internal temperature reads 135°F
    (57°C) in the thickest part.
9.	Add vegetable oil to cast iron skillet and heat on high until ripping hot.
    Cut remaining lemon in half. Brown all sides of pork roast and lemon using
    tongs.
10.	Juice the lemon into the remaining oil from the garlic/rosemary herb spread.
    Add freshly chopped parsley. Whisk with fork until emulsified. Season with
    salt and pepper.
11.	Slice roast into ½ inch thick slices and top with lemon herb vinaigrette.

## Notes

- Use good quality olive oil and fresh herbs.
