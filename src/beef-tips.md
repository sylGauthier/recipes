# Beef Tips in Gravy on Sour Cream Mashed Potatoes

Tender chunks of meat in a rich brown gravy poured over sour cream mashed
potatoes, made in a pressure cooker.

## Ingredients

- Any lean, tough cut of meat (ex. round steak).
- Unprocessed animal fat of some kind (ex. beef suet, mutton fat).
- Shredded cheese of your choice.
- Small amount of flour.
- Beef bouillon (optional).
- Red wine (optional).
- [Sour cream potato mash](sour-cream-mash-potato).

## Directions

1. Throw your pressure cooker with an open lid onto high heat or turn it onto
   saute mode if it's electric.
2. Chop up the fat into very small, uniform cubes or strips and begin to saute
   it in the pressure cooker.
3. Chop up your meat into medium, uniform cubes or strips and add it to the fat.
4. *Optional*: If you are not using red wine as a deglaze in step 7 or are not
   cooking a large amount (~2+ pounds/~1+ kg) of meat, you may want to add a
   teaspoon or so of beef bouillon into the pressure cooker to intensify the
   beef flavor of the gravy.
5. Add a generous amount of salt and pepper to taste along with a tiny pinch of
   garlic powder and stir (be very conservative with the garlic powder).
6. Once the meat is sufficiently browned off and there is a nice glaze forming
   on the bottom of the cooker, deglaze the cooker using hot water or red wine
   (optional) for more flavor.
7. Put the top on your pressure cooker and allow the meat to cook for around 30
   minutes on low heat while you prepare your mashed potatoes.
8. After half an hour, vent your pressure cooker, remove the lid, and put the
   cooker back on low heat.
9. Add a small amount of hot water until the liquid in the cooker is a bit more
   than the amount of gravy you want, then allow it to come to a boil.
10. In a small bowl, mix up some flour with warm water to the consistency of a
    very runny batter.
11. Very slowly begin adding flour water into the pot while constantly stirring
    until the gravy thickens and reaches the consistency you desire (it's very
    easy to overthicken the gravy here, don't overdo it!).
12. Turn off the heat and plate on top of your sour cream mashed potatoes.
