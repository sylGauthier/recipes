# Demi-glace

This is a take on a traditional demi-glace without needing to buy an
astronomically large amount of veal bones. Use this as your main base for pan
sauces, an extra flavor bomb, or a replacement for recipes that call for broth
or stock.

## Ingredients

- 1 qt (32 oz, 946mL) low-sodium broth or stock.
- 1 1/4 oz (7g) packet unflavored, unsweetened gelatin.
- 1 teaspoon (5mL) tomato paste.
- 1 teaspoon (5mL) low-sodium soy sauce.
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder (optional).

## Directions

1. Put the tomato paste in a large pot, then turn the heat on medium.
2. Spread the paste around the bottom of the pot and stir until it just barely
   starts to brown.
3. Deglaze with the broth.
4. Stir in all other ingredients and boil over high heat until reduced to about
   1/6th of its original volume.
5. Freeze in ice cub trays.

## Notes

- Multiply by six to yield several weeks worth of demi-glace ice cubes.
