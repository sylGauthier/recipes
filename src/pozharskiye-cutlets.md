# Pozharskiye Cutlets

Famous Russian cutlet recipe, favored by Nicholas I.  Despite what seems to be
a massive amount of butter required, they're rather light, yet creamy.

## Ingredients

- Chicken mince.
- Butter, 1/4 to 1/2 per weight of chicken, to taste.
- Eggs (~1 egg per 500g chicken, plus 3-5 for the breading).
- A couple white bread loaves.
- Spices/salt (optional, recommended).
- Non-lard based, non-chunky sauce (optional).
- Onions (optional).

## Directions

1. Prepare 2 medium-sized and 1 extra large bowl, a few plates and a regular
   frying pan.
2. Get the chicken out of the cold and into the XL bowl. Butter, too, but onto a
   plate.
4. While they warm up, crumb up the bread into a bowl.
5. Mince the chicken, if necessary. Mince the onions, if you desire them. Divide
   butter, once softened, into medium bits.
6. Add eggs to the meat and put a few into a medium bowl; mix both bowls'
   contents thoroughly.
7. Add the spices, salt and/or sauce of your choosing.
8. Add the softened-up butter to the XL bowl and mix thoroughly.
9. Make a test cutlet by rolling up a small ball of the mince, then dipping it
   into the bread, then into the eggs, then into the bread again, compounding
   the breading slightly between dips. More dips means less leaked butter/juice,
   but don't overdo it lest you want more bread than meat in your cutlet.
10. Fry, let cool and then taste the cutlet. (Pozharskiye are very juicy, so
    liquid in the pan is to be expected.)
11. If unsatisfied, add more flavoring or throw everything away. If satisfied,
    repeat step 9.
