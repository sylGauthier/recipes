# Basic Sweet Potato Fries Recipe

A simple, tasty, and healthy carb based snack.

## Ingredients

- 1-2 Sweet Potatoes (try different types).
- Olive Oil.
- Cinnamon.
- Rosemary (optional).

## Instructions

1. Set oven heat to 425°F (220°C).
2. Grab a pan and put a layer of parchment paper (or aluminum foil) on it.
3. Chop the potato(es) on your cutting board with a sharp knife throwing them
   onto the pan.
4. Drizzle the fries with olive oil. Toss the fries with clean hands to coat the
   fries in olive oil. Now wash your hands with soap to remove excess olive oil.
5. Top generously with cinnamon and salt. Pepper and/or rosemary may be added
   for additional flavor if desired.
6. Put in preheated oven. Setting timer for 20 minutes.
7. At 20 minutes, flip the fries. Rubber tongs make it easy to grab and turn a
   lot.
8. Return to oven setting timer for another 10-20 minutes depending on quality
   of the oven and desired crispiness.
9. Serve in a glass bowl.

## Notes

- A fast method to cut the sweet potatoes is first into fourths, slice the
  fourths, chops the sliced layers while stacked into fries.
- If you want to experiment with a variety of fats, consider combining the olive
  oil with grass-fed butter and coconut oil.
