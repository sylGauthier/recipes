# Pasta (store bought)

This is a simple outline of how to cook pasta.

## Ingredients

- pasta
- basil (optional)
- butter (optional)

## Directions

1. Fill a large pot about half or 3/4th full with water.
2. Salt the water profusely. The rule of thumb is that water for boiling pasta
   should taste as salty as the sea.
3. Bring water to a rolling boil.
4. Now add pasta.
5. Keep it boiling, but decrease heat as it tries to overflow.
6. Wait until pasta is at the preferred softness (see below), then strain it.
7. While the pasta is sitting in your strainer, you may add basil leaves or
   other herbs and aromatics.
8. Optional: take a knob or so of room temperature butter and add it in and
   stirring it, melting it into the pasta.

## Notes

The often recommended way to cook most pasta is *al dente*, which often means
"slightly under cooked" or with a subtle firmness that makes it still
substantial.
