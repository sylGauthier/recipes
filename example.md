# This is the dish title

Provide a very brief description of the dish in one or two sentences. This is
mandatory.

- Prep time: 10 minutes.
- Cook time: 30 minutes.
- Servings: 4.

## Ingredients

- There must be a blank line above all lists.
- List the ingredients
- in an unordered list
- similar to this.
- Note the capitalized letters at the beginning and the period at the end.
- List amounts if necessary.
- Put (optional) at the end of optional ingredients.

## Directions

1. Now using an ordered list,
2. give the directions to prepare the dish.
3. Do **not** add unnecessary blank lines between items.
4. If necessary,
5. an image can be included between some directions if needed to explain something particular.
6. But that should be kept to a minimum to reduce bandwidth and aid in simplicity.
7. Don't conclude with "enjoy!!! :DDD :))", if you need to put a final
   instruction, just put "Serve.".

## Notes

This part is optional. Put here anything that might be worth knowing, based on
your personal experience with the dish, but **in an impersonal tone**. Don't use
"I", "my", etc.

## Contribution

Contributors are in an unordered list, one per line, followed by a period (`.`).

Your name **must** be one of:
- Your real name.
- A screen name that you use.
- `Anonymous`.

You can specify **one** website linked to you, on the same line, separated by
`--`.

**No donation links**, beggars are not welcome here. You put it on your website
if you want but it has no place in a recipe.

Note that your commit name may be used to sign the recipe depending on the way
people chose to display this list, so for full anonymity either commit with a
name that can't be traced back to you, or ask someone else to commit for you.
